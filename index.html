<p class="ex"><font size = 5>There is a lot of excitement about Bitcoin and the underlying technology -- the blockchain. People make bold statements like “Bitcoin is worthless/a bubble/a Ponzi scheme...” or “Bitcoin is the future of money”. The blockchain is hailed as a <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain">"foundational"</a> technology. Along with this excitement, there are many explanations and primers on what Bitcoin is and how the blockchain technology works. But there don't seem to be good summaries of the economics of Bitcoin and the blockchain. What I mean by this is things like:
<ul>
  <li>Where does Bitcoin’s value come from?</li>
  <li>Is Bitcoin a currency? A commodity?</li>
  <li>What is useful about having a decentralized currency?</li>
  <li>How can the blockchain affect businesses?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="ex"><font size = 5>Without having answers to questions like this, it’s hard to think about where Bitcoin could go, and to evaluate the strong beliefs people have about it. This guide is an attempt to provide a framework for thinking about the potential economic impacts of Bitcoin and the blockchain technology.</p>

<p class="ex"><font size = 5>This is not a technical guide to the technology behind Bitcoin, but there is a minimum you need to know to follow the rest of the guide and so Part 0 gives the necessary background. Part 1 then addresses the main economic issues around Bitcoin, and is divided into four sections. Part 2 then discusses the blockchain technology, starting with general considerations before getting into how it might affect businesses.</p>

<p class="ex"><font size = 5>This is also not an investment guide, and in general I'm not trying to make predictions. Instead the aim is to put together, in one place, a clear explanation of why people are excited about the potential economic impacts of Bitcoin and the blockchain.</p>
