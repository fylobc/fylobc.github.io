<p class="ex"><font size = 5>There is a lot of excitement around Bitcoin and the underlying technology - the blockchain. People make bold statements like “Bitcoin is worthless/a bubble/a Ponzi scheme...” or “Bitcoin is the future of money”, while the blockchain is hailed as a <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain">"foundational"</a> technology. Along with this excitement, there are many explanations and primers on what Bitcoin is and how the blockchain technology works. But there don't seem to be good discussions of the socio-economic implications of Bitcoin and the blockchain. What I mean by this is things like:
<ul>
  <li>Where does Bitcoin’s value come from?</li>
  <li>Is Bitcoin a currency? A commodity?</li>
  <li>What is useful about having a decentralized currency?</li>
  <li>What are the general applications of the blockchain technology?</li>
  <li>How might the blockchain affect the way businesses are structured?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="ex"><font size = 5>This is not a technical guide to the Bitcoin and the blockchain, but there is a minimum you need to know and so the first essay summarizes this. This is also not an investment guide, and in general I'm not trying to make predictions. Instead the aim is to think clearly about why people are excited about the potential economic impacts of Bitcoin and the blockchain. The essays are listed on the sidebar, and there is also a resources page with a link to useful websites and articles for doing your own research.
