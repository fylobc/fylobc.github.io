title: "Part 2: The Economics of Mining"

<h2>Individual Miners</h2>

<p>The economics for individual miners is pretty simply. As long as the added value of Bitcoin is positive, it’s worth mining for Bitcoin. In practice, this means that Bitcoin mining happens in places where electricity is cheap.</p>

<p>There are conglomerates of miners, however. This is an issue, because if the conglomerate becomes too big (basically if 51% of the miners team up) they can control the whole mining process and then it is possible to commit double spend, commit fraud, etc. Basically, Bitcoin wouldn’t be decentralized anymore. This does seem like another danger of Bitcoin. You have to trust that no single entity will dominate the mining process. A conglomeration of miners did get too big once, but they voluntarily decreased in size in order to keep the Bitcoin network safe.</p>

<p>Right now about 10 mining groups dominate Bitcoin mining. This is somewhat worrying, but it is hoped that future advances in mining technology will allow mining to become more decentralized again.</p>

<p>Because the hardware costs are relatively small, Bitcoin mining is essentially a way of creating value out of electricity. This has a couple of interesting implications from both a geopolitical point of view, and from the point of view of individuals.</p>

<p>On an international level, the existence of Bitcoin mining is an advantage for countries where electricity generation is cheap. Traditionally, these countries might have exported power (whether through power lines or by exporting coal or gas) to countries which do not have large energy resources. With Bitcoin mining, energy-rich countries could instead use their excess resources to mine for Bitcoin. Since the Bitcoin is more valuable than the electricity, this is like a tax on the power that would have been exported.</p>

<p>This has implications on a more local level as well. Many renewables have issues with reliability and with variable levels of energy production: think of solar power generation, which produces most energy during the day, when energy demand is actually relatively low. Bitcoin mining is a way of regularizing demand, for instance there could be more mining at times when energy is cheap and less when energy is more expensive. In this way, energy demand can be controlled to fit the portfolio of local energy sources.</p>

<h2>Mining and Electricity Markets</h2>

<p>Because the hardware costs are relatively small, Bitcoin mining is essentially a way of creating value out of electricity. This has a couple of interesting implications from both a geopolitical point of view, and from the point of view of individuals.</p>

<p>Now think about individuals. Governments generally have a strong control on local energy markets, because they control production, distribution, etc. This means that they can control the price of electricity. But Bitcoin mining is a way for individuals to access global energy markets. Suppose your local government is artificially keeping the price of electricity low. You could take advantage of that to mine and sell Bitcoin, whose price is determined, in part, by international energy markets.</p>

<p>This is an example of how Bitcoin decentralizes power, in this case the power governments have over local energy prices. More implications of the way in which Bitcoin decentralizes power are discussed in section 3. For now, the main takeaway is that Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining are powerful ways of taking advantage of geographic and temporal variability in the price of energy production.</p>
