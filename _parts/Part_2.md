title: "The Economics of Mining"
---

<p>At first glance, the economics of mining is pretty simple. Because the hardware costs are relatively small, Bitcoin mining is essentially a way of creating value out of electricity. As long as the added value of Bitcoin is positive - as long as you can sell it for more than it takes to mine it - it is worth mining for Bitcoin. In practice, this means that Bitcoin mining happens in places where electricity is cheap.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin mining as arbitrage</h2>

<p><i>Arbitrage</i> is when you buy something in one market and then sell it in another market where it is more expensive. An example might be if a lamp cost $10 at Target and $12 on Amazon; you could go to Target, buy some lamps and then sell them on Amazon. Arbitrage can also happen in time: suppose the price of heating oil is higher in the winter than in the summer. You could buy some heating oil in the summer, then sell it off in the winter.</p>

<p>So Bitcoin mining it a kind of arbitrage, "buying" cheap electricity by mining and then selling the electricity in the form of Bitcoin. This could happen in time: mining could happen when electricity is cheap, or space: mining could happen where electricity is cheap.</p>

<h2>Some examples</h2>

<p>Let's think about some examples of how people might use Bitcoin for arbitrage</p>

<p>-On an international level, the existence of Bitcoin mining is an advantage for countries where electricity generation is cheap. Traditionally, these countries might have exported power (whether through power lines or by exporting coal or gas) to countries which do not have large energy resources. With Bitcoin mining, energy-rich countries could instead use their excess resources to mine for Bitcoin. Since the Bitcoin is more valuable than the electricity, this is like a tax on the power that would have been exported.</p>

<p>-On a more local level, many renewables have issues with reliability and with variable levels of energy production: think of solar power generation, which produces most energy during the day, when energy demand is actually relatively low. Bitcoin mining is a way of regularizing demand, for instance there could be more mining at times when energy is cheap and less when energy is more expensive. In this way, energy demand can be controlled to fit the portfolio of local energy sources.</p>

<p>-Now think about individuals. Governments generally have a strong control on local energy markets, because they control production, distribution, etc. This means that they can control the price of electricity. But Bitcoin mining is a way for individuals to access global energy markets. Suppose your local government is artificially keeping the price of electricity low. You could take advantage of that to mine and sell Bitcoin, whose price is determined, in part, by international energy markets.</p>

<p>This is an example of how Bitcoin decentralizes power, in this case the power governments have over local energy prices. More implications of the way in which Bitcoin decentralizes power are discussed in section 3. For now, the main takeaway is that Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining are powerful ways of taking advantage of geographic and temporal variability in the price of energy production.</p>
