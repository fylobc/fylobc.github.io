title: "Part 4: Can Bitcoin Function as a Currency? "
---

<p>To answer this, let’s start by thinking about some useful properties for a currency. It should be:
<ul style="font-size:x-large;">
  <li>Easy to transport</li>
  <li>Divisible</li>
  <li>Standardized; i.e., have a well advertised price</li>
  <li>Easy/cheap to use</li>
  <li>Have a relatively stable price</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Bitcoin has the first three properties, but at present it does not have the last two. It can take a long time for transactions to be verified, and the transaction costs are still quite high ( ). New developments like the Lightning Network, are on the way, however, so it seems plausible that Bitcoin could one day function as a useful digital currency. So in theory, Bitcoin could be easy and cheap to use in the near-future.</p>

<p>But the price of Bitcoin is very volatile right now. Skeptics argue that this is because it is decentralized and there is no central bank regulating its value. The value of regular currencies, like the dollar or the Euro, is controlled by central banks, which can print more money, buy money and change interest rates to control the rate of inflation of the currency, as well as its supply. In contrast, because Bitcoin is decentralized there is no authority keeping its value stable.</p>

<p>Decentralization is fully discussed in section 4, and it’s important to remember for now that Bitcoin is still a new commodity, whose value could stabilize eventually. For comparison, the price of gold fluctuates by %, while the price of the dollar fluctuates by %. So it is possible that Bitcoin would be used as a currency if it’s value settled down.</p>

<h2>How could Bitcoin’s price stabilize?</h2>

<p>The most likely way for Bitcoin’s price to stabilize is for large institutions (i.e., governments) to maintain large stores of Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin would then probably be determined by an equilibrium between the different investors.</p>

<p>I don’t know what kind of equilibrium this would end up in, but you could imagine that the price would be determined by the relative economies. One institution might sell off a large amount of Bitcoin because a lower price is beneficial for its economy, or it might sell of Bitcoin because a lower price would hurt a rival economy.</p>

<p>In a sense then, the single central bank would be replaced by a group of central banks. In a lot of ways, the price might be determined in a similar fashion to the price of oil, with countries where Bitcoin mining is favorable being like countries which have large oil resources.</p>


<h2>Some more monologues</h2>

<p>It’s not worth speculating too much about the future of Bitcoin, but there are two analogues for thinking about a future in which Bitcoin is widely used. The first of these is the Euro, which is the currency used throughout the Euro-zone countries. This has had major issues because its value may be appropriate for some countries but not for others. So for instance, Greece’s economy has struggled.</p>

<p>Another analogy is the way the US dollar is a widely used currency. Some currencies are pinned to the price of the US dollar, as the countries try to keep the exchange rate with the US dollar approximately fixed. This has advantages and disadvantages. Perhaps people will use both Bitcoin and their local currency, just as people in some countries now accept dollars in addition to their local currency. Which they prefer would then depend on the exchange rate between the two.</p>

<p>Both of these analogues are imperfect, because the Euro and the dollar are controlled by central banks, but they don’t put Bitcoin in a favorable light. The US dollar analogy is more favorable, and is probably the more likely end result, with people going back and forth between Bitcoin and other currencies depending on the relative exchange rates. This could have important implications, for instance in countries with very unstable currencies or which are poorly run, as Bitcoin could act as a hedge (Note that it would be easier to obtain Bitcoin than to get dollars).</p>
