title: "1. Into Friedland"

“They used to invite me to give lectures at their headquarters all the time,” Professor Ervin said. “Google, Amazon, Apple. But I started feeling uncomfortable and stopped going, so they stopped inviting me.”

“Why did you find it uncomfortable?” Lisa asked. “Was the attention too much?”

“No, it wasn’t that,” Professor Ervin answered. She paused for a moment. “There is an undercurrent of fanaticism to it all. The people who really make it – and they need this to achieve what they do – they’re true believers. In themselves, in the power of technology, of engineering. Human ingenuity, really. Ultimately, they believe that if they think about something for long enough, they’ll find a neat answer.”

“Whereas in fact the world is a messy place.”

“In a sense yes, but it’s more about being dogmatic. In a deep way, they suffer from confirmation bias. They build theories about the world, which they’re willing to test and discard if necessary. But they don’t question the fundamental assumption about whether the world can be theorized at all.”

“There’s something more superficial to it as well, isn’t there? They take things very personally.”

“Yes, exactly. Fanatics always do. If you start questioning them it doesn’t take long before they feel as though their core beliefs are being undermined. Things get existential quickly."

Lisa nodded and looked through the notes she had made in preparation for the meeting. “So what’s your advice?”

“It’s a bit of a Catch-22. You'll want to keep an open mind, because they will have useful ideas. And their optimism is infectious, you’ll feel energized. But you should also be wary. Listen to what they have to say, then give yourself some time to process it. There might be a detail that bothers you.”

“Thanks, I’ll keep that in mind. And thanks again for meeting with me.”

“My pleasure. It's been fascinating to watch the Friedland experiment from a distance, and I’m curious to see how your meeting plays out,” Professor Ervin said as she walked Lisa to the door. “Safe travels.”

Lisa looked out of the window and thought of that line from Blood Meridian: <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=s-QzccStux4C&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=The+floor+of+the+playa+lay+smooth+and+unbroken+by+any+track+and+the+mountains&source=bl&ots=hpVZhZfDod&sig=tZsiYYv6B8mVy_-6ceOdPzWUyAM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjypZPO6rnbAhUI7p8KHaW-ArkQ6AEIOjAC#v=onepage&q=The%20floor%20of%20the%20playa%20lay%20smooth%20and%20unbroken%20by%20any%20track%20and%20the%20mountains&f=false">“The floor of the playa lay smooth and unbroken by any track and the mountains in their blue islands stood footless in the void like floating temples.”</a> She tried to rework it for the Pacific, which was smooth and unbroken and blue below her, separated by white islands of cloud.

She didn't have enough experience to say whether it was better than other first class services, but it was a nice ride. The traditional way of getting to Friedland was via private jet, and Aviato was the only commercial airline that had a license to land on the island (this was deliberate of course), so it was expensive. But the team had been sent first class since the negotiations started the day after they landed. Lisa had a private pod with an L-shaped couch, a window and a 50-inch screen, and the wireless was good enough to FaceTime with her husband for an hour. Everything was over-designed, as you’d expect, advertising its innovation, and the micro-adjustments made by the plane’s navigation system kept the plane moving smoothly through the air. It reminded Lisa of riding on a high speed train.

She still felt uneasy about the foreigness of the people running Friedland. She was used to negotiating with people from similar backgrounds to herself: policy analysts, lawyers, career politicians; but Friedland’s governing council was made up of tech entrepreneurs, investors and academics. It was more like going to a board meeting, or even participating in a Reddit thread, and she had no feel for what the island's stance was going to be. This was the first time Friedland had engaged in international diplomacy since the negotiations to create the island wrapped up seven years ago. From the outside, it wasn't even clear how decisions were made on the island. It was known that Friedland had stuck with the governing council-model laid out in the agreement for its formation, but some decisions were also made via an elaborate online voting system, which all residents could participate in. 

Outsiders also couldn’t access the island's property agreements, though in theory there was enough space for Friedland to take in 10 000 refugees, especially since its inhabitants tended to travel a lot. If the residents were particularly moved, they might even be persuaded to build another island to house refugees. That was the dream scenario, but she didn’t rule it out. As everyone had stressed to her, the people who lived in Friedland liked thinking outside the box, and building a new island was an innovative way of addressing the refugee crisis.

On the other hand, Friedland was an oasis of techno-libertarians, who didn’t seem like the sort of people who worried too much about things like housing refugees. Lisa had read that one of the island’s main philanthropic endeavors was the Artificial Intelligence Containment Institute, which studied how to control superintelligent programs. To the Friedland community these were the greatest risk to humanity and funding this research was viewed as the most effective form of philanthropy.

So the negotiating team had had to prepare for any possibility, from outright rejection to an offer to house a substantial fraction of the global refugee population. Lisa had met with various people who might give her some insight on what to expect: political scientists, economists, psychologists and people in tech who hadn’t moved to the island; but she hadn't gotten anything more than general negotiating advice. The problem was that no one had ever moved back off the island, so all the information available to the team came from the agreement founding Friedland and from trawling through the internet and public posts on social media. It had occurred to Lisa that the island might encourage a culture of secrecy exactly to gain an advantage in negotiations with outsiders.

A welcome party waited by the terminal for Lisa and her team as they deplaned at Nozick airport. Dressed casually, in sandals, t-shirts and shorts, they quickly fanned out in groups of two to greet the visitors as they walked from the plane to the terminal. A man and a woman approached Lisa, who felt hot and overdressed by comparison, and the man asked "Lisa Schwartz?"

"Yes that's me."

“Great, nice to meet you," the man said and extended his hand. "I’m Luis, and this is Greta. We’re here to take you to your apartments."

"Wonderful, thank you," Lisa replied. She hadn't been sure what to expect.

"How was the flight?"

"Good, very smooth."

"I'm glad to hear it. Yea Aviato's a great airline."

"You get what you pay for I guess."

"Haha, yes, very true...Here, let me take your bag.”

“Thank you,” Lisa replied as Luis took the handle of her roller bag.

“We’ve split you up across four apartments, four in each," he explained as they walked through the terminal. "They’re on the other side of the island, the North Shore, looking out over the water. They're nice, I think you’ll like them.”

“Sounds great. And transportation?”

“Lyft works here just like anywhere else, you can just call a car. They go from individual units to six people vans.”

“Excellent.” 

Luis led them out of the airport and ordered a four person car for Lisa, Greta, Suhil (the other lead negotiator) and himself. The rest of the group also got into four person cars, with two visitors and two hosts in each.

The lead car was quiet at first, as the hosts respected that Lisa and Suhil were tired from the long trip and let them take the island in. 

It was like being an aircraft carrier or one of the artificial islands off Dubai, except that the scale was ten times larger. The water was ever-present -- with the windows rolled down Lisa and Suhil could smell the salt -- and the island was so massive it didn't feel the waves. 

There was a studied lack of sterility to Friedland, although it had only been completed five years ago. The master urban plan had been done by B.I.G., but there had been competitions to design individual neighborhoors and even individual buildings, so each part of the island had a distinct character, though everything was hyper-modern and clearly designed with the help of software. In some neighborhoods the apartment blocks seemed almost austere in the precision of their design, in others the buildings were amorphous, with strange shapes intersecting each other at odd angles. In general the buildings were four or five stories high, though there were some larger complexes which seemed to be corporate offices. Parks and sports fields were scattered throughout, as were some gated compounds which Lisa guessed hid the mansions of the wealthier islanders from view. The streets had wide bike lanes and tree-lined pavements, and cars moved along them in perfect synchonization, except for some narrows side streets which seemed to be reserved for pedestrians and cyclists.

The city bustled, but it felt undercrowded, and Lisa made a mental note that the island could easily support an increase in population. 

After maneuvering through the neighborhoods bordering the airstrip, the car took a ramp onto a wide highway which bisected the middle of the island and smoothly accelerated to the faster speed limit. 

"The roads have a two-tiered structure," Greta explained. "Individual neighborhoods are designed to have a walkable, intuitive structure, and are not necessarily on a grid. Then main connector roads join the neighborhoods together. We just got on the biggest connector, which goes from the South Shore to the North Shore. It's a bit more expensive to go this way, instead of going through the neighborhoods, but we'll save some time."

"Interesting," Suhil said. "So are you guys our tour guides as well?"

"Yes sort of," Greta answered. "We normally help with the orientation of new residents."

"It's something that could be automated, but studies have shown that new residents get more out of human-led orientations," Luis added.

"The rate of new people coming to the island has slowed down over the last few years, so we don't do it very often anymore," Greta continued. "Maybe once a month at this point. But the council thought it would be helpful for you guys to have some folks to show you around."

"Yes it's great, thanks," Lisa agreed. "Your island is a very mysterious place."

Luis and Greta both grinned sheepishly. "Yes, you could say that," Luis said. "We try to be selective about the kind of person who comes here. We don't want to discourage people from moving here, but we do want to make them work a bit for it. Speak to people and do some research."

"So it's kind of a word-of-mouth thing?" Suhil asked. "You have to get a friend of a friend to give you the details?"

"You could say that, yes. We also actively invite some people who we feel the community might benefit from."

"But it's also a matter of self-preservation," Greta stressed. "There were fears that some countries or institutions might want to intervene in the island one day, because they disagreed with one of our policies or they wanted to target an individual. By keeping them out of the loop we give them less reason to interfere."

"You have your own social media as well, right? Like a members-only version of Twitter?" Lisa asked.

"Yes, Delphi -- like the oracle," Greta answered. "It's a kind of bulletin board for the island, where people can make announcements, post notes, request help."

"Is it anonymous?" Suhil asked.

"Of course," Luis said.

They quickly got to the other size of the island, which was only ten kilometers long, and took an off ramp into the North Shore. The car winded through a few more neighborhoods and then finally, on the edge of the water, approached a set of four tall, glass apartment buildings, shaped like sails expanded in the wind. 

The seven other cars had been following Lisa's car in a convoy, and they all parked in unison outside the atrium of the center-left tower. The passengers got out, and Luis and Greta led them into the building.

"Your guides will now give you instructions for how to get to your apartments," Greta announced to the group. "Each apartment has two bedrooms, a kitchen and a living room. The kitchens are stocked based on the dietary preferences you gave us and we have also left guides to the amenities in the building as well as annotated maps of the neighborhood on the kitchen tables. The doors to the apartments are voice-controlled, based on the voice samples you sent us before coming here, so there is no need for keys. We will meet you here tomorrow at 8AM to bring you downtown for the meeting."
