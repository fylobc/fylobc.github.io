title: "1. Into Friedland"

“They used to invite me to give lectures at their headquarters all the time,” Professor Ervin said. “Google, Amazon, Apple. But I started feeling uncomfortable and stopped going, so they stopped inviting me.”

“Why did you find it uncomfortable?” Lisa asked. “Was the attention too much?”

“No, it wasn’t that,” Professor Ervin answered. She paused for a moment. “There is an undercurrent of fanaticism to it all. The people who really make it – and they need this to achieve what they do – they’re true believers. In themselves, in the power of technology, of engineering. Human ingenuity, really. Ultimately, they believe that if they think about something for long enough, they’ll find a neat and clean answer.”

“Whereas in fact the world is a messy place.”

“In a sense yes, but it’s more about being dogmatic. In a deep way, they suffer from confirmation bias. They build theories about the world, which they’re willing to test and discard if necessary. But they don’t question the fundamental assumption about whether the world can be theorized at all.”

“There’s also something superficial to it as well, isn’t there? They take things very personally.”

“Yes, exactly. Fanatics always do. If you start questioning them it doesn’t take long before they feel as though their core beliefs are being undermined. Things get existential quickly."

Lisa nodded and looked through the notes she had made in preparation for the meeting. “So what’s your advice?” she asked.

“It’s a bit of a Catch-22,” Professor Ervin said. “You want to keep an open mind, because they will have useful ideas. And their optimism is infectious, you’ll feel energized. But you should also be wary. Listen to what they have to say, then give yourself some time to process it. You might realize there’s a detail that bothers you.”

“Thanks, I’ll keep that in mind. And thanks again for meeting with me.”

“My pleasure. It's been fascinating to watch the Friedland experiment from a distance, and I’m curious to see how your meeting plays out,” Professor Ervin said as she walked Lisa to the door. “Safe travels.”

Lisa looked out of the window and thought of that line from Blood Meridian: “The floor of the playa lay smooth and unbroken by any track and the mountains in their blue islands stood footless in the void like floating temples.” She tried to rework it for the Pacific, which was smooth and unbroken and blue below her, separated by white islands of cloud.

She wasn’t enough of a connoisseur to say whether it was better than other first class services, but it was a nice ride. She had a private pod with an L-shaped couch, a window and a 50-inch screen, and the wireless was good enough to FaceTime with her husband for an hour. Everything was over-designed, as you’d expect, advertising its innovation, and the flight was perfectly smooth, with the plane’s navigation system keeping them away from any turbulence. It reminded Lisa of riding on a high speed train.

The traditional way of getting to Friedland was via private jet, and Aviato was the only commercial airline that had a license to land on the island (this was deliberate of course), so it was expensive, but the team had been sent first class since the negotiations started the day after they landed. 

Lisa still felt uneasy about the foreigness of the people running Friedland. She was used to negotiating with people from similar backgrounds to herself: policy analysts, lawyers, career politicians. Friedland’s governing council was made up of tech entrepreneurs, investors and academics. It was more like going to a board meeting, or even participating in a Reddit thread. 

She still had no feel for what the island's stance was going to be. This was the first time Friedland had been engaged in international diplomacy since the negotiations to create the island wrapped up seven years ago. They weren't even sure how the decisions would be made. It was known that Friedland had stuck with the governing council-model laid out in the agreement for its formation, but some decisions were also made via an elaborate online voting system, which all residents could participate in. It occurred to Lisa that the island might encourage a culture of secrecy exactly to gain an advantage in negotiating with outsiders.

Outsiders also couldn’t access the island's property agreements, though in theory there was enough space for Friedland to take in 10 000 refugees, especially since so many of its inhabitants seemed to travel a lot. If the residents were particularly moved, they might even build a new island to house refugees and potentially take in more than 10 000. That was the dream scenario, but she didn’t rule it out. As everyone had stressed to her, the people who lived in Friedland liked thinking outside the box, and building a new island was an innovative way of addressing the refugee crisis.

On the other hand, Friedland was an oasis of techno-libertarians, who didn’t seem like the sort of people who worried too much about issues like housing refugees. Lisa had read that one of the island’s main philanthropic endeavors was the Artificial Intelligence Containment Institute, which studied how to control superintelligent programs. The Friedland community considered these to be the most dangerous risk to humanity and funding this research was viewed as the most effective form of philanthropy.

So the team had had to prepare for any possibility, from outright rejection to an offer to house a substantial fraction of the global refugee population. Lisa had met with various people who might give her some insight on what to expect: political scientists, economists, psychologists and people in tech who hadn’t moved to the island, but no one had been able to give her the kind of details she needed to prepare properly. The problem was no one had ever moved back off the island, so all the information the team had came from the agreement founding Friedland and from trawling through the internet and public posts on social media.

Despite her unease, there was nothing more for Lisa to do, so she tried to relax as the plane started its descent over the south Pacific.

A group of two men and a woman met Lisa and her team as they de-planed at Nozick airport. They were dressed casually, in sandals, plaid shirts and shorts, and Lisa felt overdressed in her white blouse and black slacks. 

“Heya,” one of the men said to Lisa, extending his right hand. “I’m Mike. This is Luis and Greta. We’re here to take you to your apartments. Here, let me take your bag.”

“Thanks,” Lisa said as the man took her roller bag.

“We’ve split you up across four apartments, four in each one. They’re on the North Shore, looking out over the water, I think you’ll like them.”

“Sounds great. And transportation?”

“Lyft works here just like anywhere else, you can just call a car. The sizes go from individual pods to six people vans.”

“Perfect,” Lisa said.

Lisa got into a four person car with Mike, Greta, and Suhil, the other lead negotiator. They made awkward small talk for a bit and then passed into silence, as the hosts respected that Lisa and Suhil were tired from the long trip.

It was like being on a cross between an aircraft carrier and one of the artificial islands off Dubai. The water was ever-present -- even in the center of the island you could smell the salt water -- but the island was so massive it didn't feel the waves. The buildings were mostly apartment blocks, four or five stories high, though there were some bungalows and family homes dotted among them, and each neighborhood had a park. The surface of the island had some gentle topography, and a hill on the eastern edge which was the highest point of the island.

What stuck out the most was the newness of everything. All the materials were clean and modern, and there was a studied lack of sterility and homogeneity. The master urban plan had been done by B.I.G., but competitions had been held to design different parts of the city, and even specific buildings, so each neighborhood had a distinct character. The car took them down a wide central avenue, which also had space for bike lanes and tree-lined pavements. Off the main road there were narrow side streets, some of them so narrow that only pedestrians and bikes could use them. 

The city bustled, but it still felt slightly undercrowded, and Lisa made a mental note that the infrastructure could easily support an increase in the population.
