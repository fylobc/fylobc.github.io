“They used to invite me to give lectures at their headquarters all the time,” Professor Ervin said. “Google, Amazon, Apple... But I started feeling more and more uncomfortable and stopped going, so they stopped inviting me.”

“Why did you find it uncomfortable?” Leila asked. “Was the attention too much?”

“No, it wasn’t that,” Professor Ervin answered. She paused for a moment. “There is an undercurrent of fanaticism to it all. The people who really make it – and they need this to achieve what they do – they’re true believers. In the power of technology, of engineering. Human ingenuity, really. Ultimately, they believe that if they think about something for long enough, they’ll find a clean answer.”

“Whereas in fact the world is a messy place.”

“In a way yes, but it’s more about being dogmatic. In a deep way, they suffer from confirmation bias. They build theories about the world, which they’re willing to test and discard if they fail. But they don’t question the fundamental assumption about whether the world can be theorized at all.”

“Interesting,” Leila said. She looked through the notes she had made in preparation for the meeting. “So what’s your advice for me?” she asked.

“It’s a bit of a Catch-22,” Professor Ervin said, and laughed. “You want to keep an open mind, because they will have useful ideas. And their optimism is infectious. You’ll feel energized. But you should also be wary. Listen to what they have to say, then give yourself some time to process it. You might realize there’s a detail that bothers you.”

“Thanks, I’ll keep that in mind. And thanks again for meeting with me.”

“My pleasure. I’ve watched the Friedland experiment from a distance, and I’m curious to see how your meeting goes,” Professor Ervin said as she walked Leila to the door. “Safe travels.”
