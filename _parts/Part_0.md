title: "1. Into Friedland"

“They used to invite me to give lectures at their headquarters all the time,” Professor Ervin said. “Google, Amazon, Apple... But I started feeling more and more uncomfortable and stopped going, so they stopped inviting me.”

“Why did you find it uncomfortable?” Lisa asked. “Was the attention too much?”

“No, it wasn’t that,” Professor Ervin answered. She paused for a moment. “There is an undercurrent of fanaticism to it all. The people who really make it – and they need this to achieve what they do – they’re true believers. In themselves, in the power of technology, of engineering. Human ingenuity, really. Ultimately, they believe that if they think about something for long enough, they’ll find a neat and clean answer.”

“Whereas in fact the world is a messy place.”

“In a way yes, but it’s more about being dogmatic. In a deep way, they suffer from confirmation bias. They build theories about the world, which they’re willing to test and discard if necessary. But they don’t question the fundamental assumption about whether the world can be theorized at all.”

“There’s also something superficial to it as well, isn’t there? They take things very personally.”

“Yes, exactly. Fanatics always do. If you start questioning them it doesn’t take long before they start to feel like you’re trying to undermine their core beliefs. Things get existential quickly.

Lisa nodded and looked through the notes she had made in preparation for the meeting. “So what’s your advice?” she asked.

“It’s a bit of a Catch-22,” Professor Ervin said, and laughed. “You want to keep an open mind, because they will have useful ideas. And their optimism is infectious, you’ll feel energized. But you should also be wary. Listen to what they have to say, then give yourself some time to process it. You might realize there’s a detail that bothers you.”

“Thanks, I’ll keep that in mind. And thanks again for meeting with me.”

“My pleasure. It's been fascinating to watch the Friedland experiment from a distance, and I’m curious to see what happens,” Professor Ervin said as she walked Lisa to the door. “Safe travels.”

Lisa looked out of the window and thought of the Cormac McCarthy line: <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=s-QzccStux4C&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=The+floor+of+the+playa+lay+smooth+and+unbroken+by+any&source=bl&ots=hpVYn0bIij&sig=0Ge8koeRhV5zK1xzXlc8HTp0kCs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiYo8CB-67bAhVCqFQKHSUSC7cQ6AEIOzAC#v=onepage&q=The%20floor%20of%20the%20playa%20lay%20smooth%20and%20unbroken%20by%20any&f=false">“The floor of the playa lay smooth and unbroken by any track and the mountains in their blue islands stood footless in the void like floating temples.”</a> She tried to rework it for the Pacific below her, which was smooth and unbroken and blue, separated by white islands of cloud.

She wasn’t enough of a connoisseur to say whether it was better than other first class experiences, but it was a nice ride. She had a private pod with a window and an L-shaped couch. She’d watched a movie on the 50-inch screen and FaceTimed her husband for an hour. Everything was over-designed, as you’d expect, advertising its innovation. The flight was perfectly smooth, as the plane’s navigation system always found the stillest air. It reminded Lisa of a high speed train.

The “traditional” way of getting to Friedland was via private jet, and Aviato was the only commercial airline that had a license to land on the island (this was deliberate of course),  so it was expensive. But the team was flying first class to be as fresh as possible; the negotiations started the day after they landed.

The foreignness of the people running Friedland made Lisa nervous. She was used to negotiating with people from similar backgrounds to herself: policy analysts, lawyers and career politicians. But Friedland’s governing council was made up of tech entrepreneurs, investors and academics. It was more like going to a board meeting, or even participating in a Reddit thread. 

She still had no feel for what their stance was going to be. This was the first time that Friedland had been engaged in international diplomacy since the negotiations to create the island ended seven years ago. 

Outsiders couldn’t access their property agreements, but in theory there was enough space for Friedland to take in 10 000 refugees, especially since so many of its inhabitants seemed to travel a lot. If the members were particularly moved by humanitarian concerns, it was also conceivable that they would build a new island to house the refugees. Maybe they could even take in much more than 10 000. That was the dream scenario, and she didn’t rule it out. As everyone had stressed to her, the people running Friedland liked thinking outside the box, and building a new island would solve a lot of problems. 

On the other hand, Friedland was an oasis of techno-libertarians, who didn’t seem like the sort of people who worried too much about issues like housing refugees. Lisa had read that one of the island’s main philanthropic endeavors was the Artificial Intelligence Containment Institute, which researched how to control superintelligent programs. The Friedland community considered these programs as existential risks to humanity, and so viewed funding this research as the most effective form of philanthropy.

So the team had had to prepare for any possibility, from outright rejection to an offer to make a big dent in the global refugee population. They weren't even sure how the decisions would be made. I was known that Friedland had stuck with the governing council laid out during the negotiations for its formation, but some decisions were also made via an elaborate online voting process, which all residents could participate in. It occurred to Lisa that the island might encourage a culture of secrecy exactly to gain an advantage in negotiating with outsiders.

In any case, the team had prepped seven different scenarios, and Lisa had visited various experts: political scientists, economists, psychologists and tech people who hadn’t moved to the island, to try to get some insights. So far no one had left the island, so she didn’t have any former residents to ask for tips, but she had done as much homework as she could.
