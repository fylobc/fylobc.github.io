title: "Where Does Bitcoin’s Value Come From?"
---

<p>The best starting point for understanding Bitcoin is comparing it with gold. There are a number of similarities between Bitcoin and gold, and so we can use what we already know about gold to understand Bitcoin. We can then build off this by thinking about the differences between gold and Bitcoin.</p>

<h2>Where does gold’s value come from?</h2>

<p>It takes time and money to mine and extract gold, so part of its cost comes from the price of the electricity, labor, etc. that went into getting it out of the ground. But we could also spend all that time and money extracting soil or other rocks, which would be worthless. The difference is that society values gold, whereas soil is basically worthless.</p>

<p>Let’s say that the price of gold is the cost of extracting it plus how much society values it, which I’m going call its “added-value”:</p>

<p><i>price gold = cost of extraction + added value</i></p>

<p>Suppose it cost $1000 to extract 1kg of gold and the added value is $3000, then the total cost of the gold would be $4000 and mining 1kg of gold adds $3000 dollars of value to society. Spending $1000 digging up soil would take away -$1000 dollars from society, since the price of the soil is $0.</p>

<p>Why does society value gold? The first reason is that it’s considered beautiful and so people make jewelry and decorations out of it. Let’s call this gold’s “intrinsic” value, since some people will always want it to make things out of.</p>

<p>The more important reason for gold’s value today, however, is that it is useful as a store of wealth. It’s very durable, relatively rare (though not too rare) and it’s easy to spot counterfeits. It also doesn’t require third-party backing: you’re not relying on a government or a bank to back up its value. A counterexample is money in a bank account, which is basically an I.O.U. from the bank promising to give you that money if you ask for it back. But if the bank goes bankrupt, the money is lost. By contrast, if you own a bar of gold, you’ll always have it (so long as you don’t lose it yourself).</p>

<p>Another counterexample is fiat currencies that are backed by government, like the US dollar. These have no intrinsic value: the paper that makes up a $20 bill isn’t worth $20 dollars. Instead, it is backed by the US government, which declares the $20 bill to be valuable. That value depends on the state of the US economy and also how the US economy is being managed. So if the US economy suddenly tanks, your $20 bill could lose much of its value. A bar of gold, on the other hand, does not depend directly on a particular government or economy for its value.</p>

<p>Gold is also a good store of wealth because of its history. People have valued gold for at least 4000 years, so even though its value fluctuates, you can be very confident it won’t ever go to zero. Furthermore, there’s a limited supply of gold, so its value won’t suddenly get wiped out by new gold flooding the market.</p>

<p>In summary, there are a lot of reasons why gold is a good store of wealth, which is why it is often used for this purpose. Going back to the first equation, the added value of gold is its intrinsic value, plus the value it has as a store of wealth, plus some ill-defined value from things like people wanting to own gold for the sake of owning it and people speculating on the price of gold. Let’s call this last part gold’s nebulous value, and write:</p>

<p><i>added value of gold = intrinsic value + value as store of wealth + nebulous value</i></p>

<h2>How does Bitcoin compare?</h2>

<p>We can write analogous terms for Bitcoin. First, the cost of extraction is the price of the hardware needed to mine Bitcoin plus the price of the electricity to run a mining rig plus the time-cost to set up a mining rig:</p>

<p><i>cost of Bitcoin extraction = hardware + electricity + time</i></p>

<p>so the real question is Bitcoin’s added value.</p>

<p>Naively, it might seem like Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, but it does. Because you can use Bitcoin anonymously, it will always have value for people who want to hide their (possibly illegal) transactions. It’s questionable whether it’s a good thing for Bitcoin to serve this purpose, but this application puts a lower limit on Bitcoin’s value.</p>

<p>Next, Bitcoin is a good store of wealth for many of the same reasons as gold: it’s durable, relatively rare, has a limited supply and, because of the blockchain technology, is hard to fake. Most importantly, however, it is not third-party backed and it is decentralized. The benefit of no third-party backing is the same as with gold, while the main benefit of being decentralized is that no one entity can step in and arbitrarily change Bitcoin’s value. (Other benefits of decentralization are discussed in more detail later).</p>

<p>There are some differences with gold in terms of Bitcoin’s value as a store of wealth, however. Bitcoin does not have a long history, so it’s always possible you’ll wake up one day and Bitcoin’s value will be wiped out because some new coin has taken its place. On the other hand, Bitcoin might be more secure than gold, which you have to store somewhere and which can be physically stolen. The anonymity is also potentially a bonus for Bitcoin’s value as a store of wealth since it is hard to target an individual to steal their wealth (or tax them).</p>

<p>Finally, Bitcoin also has nebulous value from people speculating, wanting to own one, etc., so we can write:</p>

<p><i>added value of Bitcoin = intrinsic value + value as store of wealth + nebulous value</i></p>

<p>As an aside, it’s often said that Bitcoin mining is terribly damaging to the environment because of all the electricity it uses. But right now Bitcoin’s added value is high, and going up quickly. So in fact, Bitcoin mining is an environmentally efficient way of adding value to society. That's not to say that we should devote more resources to mining, but in evaluating the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining we have to think about the value it adds to society.</p>


<h2>What if Bitcoin is used as a currency?</h2>

<p>This is a starting point for thinking about Bitcoin's value. It is possible that this is the end of the story and the main use for Bitcoin is as a store of wealth, but Bitcoin may also end up being widely used as digital currency. I’m going to discuss this possibility more later, and it's harder to evaluate what would set its value in this case. At present, Bitcoin is not widely used as a currency, however, and its value comes mostly as a store of wealth and from speculation (betting on its nebulous value).</p>
