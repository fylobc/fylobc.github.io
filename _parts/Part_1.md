They left the club and walked back together to her place. Their ears were ringing but the sounds of trucks moving among the warehouses and being unloaded were clear in the predawn air. The streets were empty otherwise and they were too dazed to notice the trucks. She let them in to her apartment at the top of a block and eventually they both fell asleep in her little bed.

<hr>

He woke up around 10, realizing after a moment where he was. Carefully sliding away from her, he got up and started putting his clothes on. She rolled over and put on her glasses, which were on the nightstand. He remembered when she took her contacts out after they got back. They smiled at each other and talked for a bit. He had a party with people from work that evening, she was getting a late lunch with some friends later. She stayed under the covers while he went to the bathroom and then they exchanged numbers. She got out of bed and led him to the door, where they hugged goodbye, and he left.

He took the subway back, conscious of how unkept he looked and groggily scrolling through Twitter and Instagram on his phone, checking the basketball scores. His ears still felt funny from the club so he didn’t put his earbuds in. He’d stopped drinking at some point last night and drank water at the club and at her place, so he wasn’t too hungover; he mainly just felt the lack of sleep.

He switched trains, got off at his stop and walked to the brownstone which he shared a floor of. His housemate Alfonso was sitting at the kitchen table, messing around on his laptop with a bowl of cereal next to him.

“Hello Mr. Curtis!” Alfonso said, smiling “How are you?”

“I’m good,” Michael replied, grinning involuntarily. “How are you? Did you guys get home OK?”

“Yea, we did,” Alfonso said. “We took an Uber pool back.”

“Nice,” Michael said as he sat down at the table.

“How about you? You went back to her place?”

“Yea. She lives close to the club. It was nice, she’s cool.”

“Yea? What does she do?”

“She works for a non-profit, something with schools, I don’t remember the details”

“Sounds interesting.”

“Yea, she’s gonna do a master’s in policy next year.”
Michael went to his room to get his water bottle, which he filled up in the kitchen sink, then went back to his room. He got undressed again, set his alarm for 1pm and lay down. The room was bright, but the sheets were cool and he quickly fell asleep again.

<hr>

The alarm went off at 1. Michael woke up, took an Advil and got his laptop. Sitting up in bed, he made the usual rounds: email, NYT, the Guardian, Slate, the Ringer, Vox. Feeling lazy, he checked Pitchfork, Fader and Gorilla vs Bear. Then. he went through Twitter again and started going through links. He was too out of it to read long articles, but the topics flashed by. Takes on the administration’s scandals and the issues Congress was having passing legislation. Digging deeper, there was a discussion about Bitcoin by some Marginal Revolution-types, some AI links. Commentary on last night’s games. Some interesting stuff, which he mentally bookmarked for later.

Finally, Michael got up and showered. He went back into the kitchen, where Alfonso was getting ready to bike to the library.

“Heading out?” Michael asked.

“Yea,” Alfonso said. “But I’ll be back later, we should get dinner.”

“Yea definitely,” Michael answered.
