title: "Decentralized Currencies and Central Banks"
---

<p>One of Bitcoin’s main appeals is that it is decentralized: there is no central authority controlling its price. This is different from more familiar currencies like the dollar or the euro, which are controlled by central banks (the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, respectively). The two main responsibilities of central banks are to control the price of their currency and to control the rate of inflation in their economic zone, which they do by printing more of their currency, buying it back or by changing interest rates -- the rate at which the central bank loans out money. (Central banks also play a role in regulating the banking industry.)</p>

<p>The price of a decentralized currency like Bitcoin is instead set entirely by the market for it. As discussed in the first essay, this is one reason why Bitcoin is a good store of wealth: because Bitcoin is not third party backed its owners are not exposed to the potentially poor decisions of central bankers. This might seem like a technical point, but Bitcoin was developed in 2009, in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, and in a sense it can be thought of as a response to that crisis and to the actions of bankers which helped cause the crisis. Some of the worst parts of the crisis were the result of poorly managed government finances; famously Greek citizens couldn’t withdraw money from their bank accounts in 2009 because the Greek government was using their assets to pay off its debt. 

<p>Another example of poor government management is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe">hyperinflation in Zimbabwe in the late 90s and 2000s</a>. At its height in November 2008 Zimbabwe's rate of inflation has been estimated at around 80 billion%. This had disastrous consequences for Zimbabwe's economy, and its citizens found the money they earned one day being worthless the next. They also couldn't get loans to raise capital, and Zimbabwe's banking sector collapsed.</p>

<p>Owners of a decentralized currency like Bitcoin would never have to worry about either of these things happening to them, no mater what their government was doing.</p>


<h2>Bitcoin in practice</h2>

<p>With no central organization regulating it, Bitcoin’s price could in theory vary a lot in time and place. For instance, you could decide with your friend that one Bitcoin is worth one dollar and keep that exchange rate between you. But in practice Bitcoin are primarily traded on large, centralized exchanges, like Coinbase and Bitfinex, and the price of Bitcoin on these exchanges sets the price of Bitcoin globally.</p>

<p>At first glance, this is pretty similar to how ordinary currencies work now, with the exchanges playing the role of banks, but the difference is that this behavior isn’t forced. You can’t opt out of the conventional financial system, but you can opt out of the exchanges on Bitcoin. So if you don’t like how Coinbase is acting, or you think there could be trouble on the horizon, you could take your Bitcoin off the exchange and store them privately yourself (it's anyways a good idea to store your Bitcoin privately and not on the exchanges). This is a bit like keeping cash under the mattress, but instead of wads of bills you would store your wallet address and private keys, and you could still carry out transactions outside of the exchanges. You could also use a decentralized exchange, or just set up your own exchange. </p>


<h2>Lack of regulation</h2>

<p>Obviously, there are also downsides to the lack of a central authority. This is discussed more in the next section on using Bitcoin as a currency, in the context of price stability. For now, I just want to mention that the lack of regulation applies to individual investors or users or Bitcoin. Investing is the process of placing bets: on the value of a stock, a currency, a piece of land, etc. Regulations are put on investments to save investors from themselves. For instance, to stop someone who has made a mistake in their analysis from placing too large a bet on a losing stock.</p>

<p>The question of regulation is long and there’s a huge literature on the subject; I’m not going to go into it here.</p>
