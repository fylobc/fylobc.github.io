title: "Decentralized Currencies and Central Banks"
---

<p>One of Bitcoin’s main appeals is that it is decentralized: there is no central authority controlling its price. In contrast, currencies like the dollar or the euro are controlled by central banks (the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, respectively). The two aims of central banks are to control the price of their currency and to control the rate of inflation in their economic zone, which they do by printing more of their currency, buying it back or by changing interest rates. Central banks also play a role in regulating the banking industry.</p>

<p>The price of a decentralized currency like Bitcoin is instead set entirely by the market. As discussed in the previous essay, this is one reason why Bitcoin is considered to be a good store of wealth, because Bitcoin is not third party backed its owners are not exposed to the potentially poor decisions of central bankers. It might seem like a technical point, but Bitcoin was developed in 2009, shortly after the financial crisis of 2008, and in many ways Bitcoin can be thought of as a response to that crisis and to the actions of central bankers which helped cause the crisis. Some of the worst consequences were the result of poorly managed government finances; famously Greek citizens couldn’t withdraw money from their bank accounts in 2009 because the Greek government was using their assets to pay off its debt. Owners of a decentralized currency like Bitcoin would never have to worry about this happening to them.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin in practice</h2>

<p>In theory, Bitcoin’s price could vary a lot in time and place. For instance, you could decide with your friend that 1 Bitcoin is worth a dollar. In practice, however, Bitcoins are primarily traded on large exchanges, like Coinbase and Bitfinex, and the price of Bitcoin on these exchanges sets the price of Bitcoin globally.</p>

<p>At first glance, this is pretty similar to how currencies work now, with the exchanges playing the role of banks. However, the difference is that this behavior isn’t forced. You can’t opt out of the conventional financial system, but you can opt out of the exchanges on Bitcoin.</p>

<p>There are at least two advantages to this possibility. The first is that it gives you a kind of insurance. If something goes wrong in conventional financial markets you’re stuck, like in the Greece example. But with a decentralized currency you can always opt out of the system. If you don’t like how Coinbase is acting, or you think there could be trouble on the horizon, you could take your Bitcoin off the exchange and store them privately yourself (it's anyways a good idea to store your Bitcoin privately and not on the exchanges). This is a bit like keeping cash under the mattress, but instead of wads of bills you would store your wallet address and private keys safely.</p>

<p>The other advantage is that you can carry out transactions outside of the exchanges. This freedom promotes creativity, since you don’t have to use Bitcoin the way it’s used by the exchanges. This is a less well defined advantage, since I don’t know how to be creative in this way, but here’s a potential scenario:</p>

<p>Suppose the price of 1 Bitcoin on the exchanges was $1000 and the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar was 1:2, so 1 Bitcoin was worth 500 euros. However, you thought that the exchange rate was going to go up to 1:3, so you wanted to acquire more euros. You could set up an exchange which offered discounted rates to buy Bitcoin using euro, but regular rates to buy Bitcoin with dollars. On your new exchange you could then acquire a lot of euro, which would increase in value when the exchange rate increased.</p>

<h2>Lack of regulation</h2>

<p>Obviously, there are also downsides to the lack of a central authority. This is discussed more in the next section on using Bitcoin as a currency, in the context of price stability. For now, I just want to mention that the lack of regulation applies to individual investors or users or Bitcoin. Investing is the process of placing bets: on the value of a stock, a currency, a piece of land, etc. Regulations are put on investments to save investors from themselves. For instance, to stop someone who has made a mistake in their analysis from placing too large a bet on a losing stock.</p>

<p>The question of regulation is long and there’s a huge literature on the subject; I’m not going to go into it here.</p>
